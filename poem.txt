Ode to a Pear

Upon the bough, a verdant dream,
A pear of ample, juicy gleam.
Its skin, a blush of gold and green,
A treasure fit for any queen.

With gentle touch, I pluck it free,
A weighty promise held for me.
Its fragrant breath, a sweet perfume,
Dispelling shadows, chasing gloom.

A bite, a burst, a sugary flood,
A nectarous gift, divinely good.
The juices trickle, chin to chest,
A taste of summer, at its best.

Oh, pear so grand, so full of grace,
A smile you bring to time and space.
Your juicy flesh, a sweet delight,
A star that shines, so pure and bright.
